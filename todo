	$$ - pid of the currently running process // not required

ERROR MESSAGES
make function to print error messages in the foll format:
	minishell: <command name>: <optional arg>: <error msg>
eg:	minishell: cd: HOME not set
eg: minishell: cat: file.txt: No such file or directory


for today:
signal handling
precede error messages for builtin commands with "bash"
set all return statuses (cd, export) (extern global variable)
return codes for builtins
minishell inside minishell, or any local executable
change pipex and handle_builtins to use chunks and not string_chunks

parsing:
	double and single quotes
echo:
skip past all -n in the beginning 
	eg: -n 
		-n -n
		-n -nnnnnn -n -nnn
